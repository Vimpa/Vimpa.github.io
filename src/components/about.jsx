                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>My name is Vilmer and I am a 23-year-old from Ursviken, near Skelleftea.
                    I am a reliable and active person who enjoys challenges and adventures.
                    In my free time, I am usually in the ski slopes, fishing, or enjoying other outdoor activities.
                    I like being creative and engaging in various technical projects. That's why in 2021,
                    I decided to start my master's program in Interaction and Design Engineering.</p>
